<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas, and is a premier liberal arts school. </p>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="public-skyline-trinity.jpg"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> While Trinity's campus is small, it is very beautiful. There are both amazing modern buildings on a campus with an "historic" feel. The bell tower can be seen from several miles away. </p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the modern buildings, excellent dorms, and trees scattered around campus. Trinity has beautiful trees around campus which make walking through campus very enjoyable. </p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because of the prestigious academics and the small school size. Trinity University offers an excellent academic environment with close professor and student interaction. This environment greatly helps learning and promotes critical thinking. I also chose Trinity for the sports. I play soccer here and am hoping to get involved in a couple other clubs on campus. Finally, I chose Trinity because of the location. It is set near San Antonio, an amazing city with lots of things to do. </p>
<p>I hope to major in business but I am taking the pre-med path because I want to be a doctor, but I would like to have a degree to fall back on. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
